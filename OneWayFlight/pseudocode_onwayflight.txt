Objective:
Reconstruct trips by using an array of multiple arrays of flight tickets, each ticket has a from destination
and to destination except our start and end trip. The objective of the this function is to sort our trips into a single array
from multiple arrays to plot out our trips as if it were on a physical map.

Plan:
we should first identify our start trip and push to an empty array

tripPlot(arr):
loop through tickets:
 if tickets[trip][start] === null:
 *note we are appending only the end point to our new array which is our start trip
	tripArr.append(arr[trip][destination])

now that we have our Start trip in our trip array we need to use our trip array and compare with our tickets
identify our first from destination by comparing our trip array start points to our tickets start points and append
the tickets array end point to our trip array.

loop through tickets and compare with trip array:
if tickets[trip][start] === trip[start]:
	trip.append(tickets[trip][destination]

By appending the destinations to our trip array we should have completely polotted trip
